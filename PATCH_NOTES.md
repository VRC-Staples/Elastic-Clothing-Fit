# Patch Notes

## v1.0.2

### Follow Neighbors limit increased to 64

The **Follow Neighbors** slider under Advanced Settings now goes up to 64 (previously capped at 32).

Follow Neighbors controls how many nearby fitted vertices each preserved vertex samples when calculating where to move. Raising the cap is useful for large preserve groups or coarser clothing meshes where 32 neighbors was not enough to produce a smooth blend at the boundary.

## v1.0.1

### Preserve Group + Offset Fine Tuning interaction

Preserved vertices that are near fitted vertices affected by an **Offset Fine Tuning** group now follow the offset-adjusted positions of those vertices, rather than only following the base shrinkwrap displacement.

Previously, offset fine-tuning was applied to fitted vertices *after* the preserve-follow step ran. This meant preserved vertices would follow the fitted mesh as if no offset adjustment had been made, then the offset would be applied to fitted vertices separately, creating a subtle mismatch at the boundary between preserved and fitted regions.

Now offset fine-tuning is applied to fitted vertices *before* the follow step. When the follow step reads the current positions of nearby fitted vertices to work out how far to pull each preserved vertex, those positions already include the offset contribution. The preserved vertices themselves are never directly pushed by the offset; the adjustment reaches them indirectly through the follow mechanism, the same way the base shrinkwrap displacement does.

**Practical effect:** If you have a waistband in the preserve group and the torso area in an offset fine-tuning group, the waistband will now move correctly with the torso's offset-adjusted position rather than lagging behind it.
